Sorting algorithms

These are some of the first algorithms to be learned in computer science because they are very versatile and appear in many applications:

\- Bubble Sort

\- Selection Sort

\- Insertion Sort

\- Quick Sort

\- Merge Sort

\- Bucket Sort

\- Heap Sort

All these algorithms will be solved with Go(Golang) language
